# DevOps and Monitoring Guide for Africa Business Bridge

This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing DevOps practices, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and monitoring solutions for the Africa Business Bridge platform.

## 1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### 1.1. CI/CD Pipeline Overview

A robust CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring code quality and reducing time-to-market.

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Source Control**: Code is pushed to GitHub.
2. **Build**: Application is built and dependencies are installed.
3. **Unit Tests**: Automated unit tests are executed.
4. **Integration Tests**: Integration tests verify component interactions.
5. **Code Quality Analysis**: Code is analyzed for quality and security issues.
6. **Security Scanning**: Dependencies and code are scanned for vulnerabilities.
7. **Staging Deployment**: Code is deployed to a staging environment for testing.
8. **End-to-End Tests**: Full application flow is tested in staging.
9. **Production Deployment**: Approved code is deployed to production.
10. **Monitoring and Alerts**: System health and performance are monitored.

### 1.2. GitHub Actions for CI/CD

GitHub Actions provides a native CI/CD solution integrated with GitHub repositories.

**Setup**:
1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory in the repository.
2. Define workflow files (YAML) for different stages of the pipeline.
3. Configure triggers (e.g., push to main branch, pull requests).
4. Define jobs and steps for each workflow stage.

**Example Workflow File** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install frontend dependencies
        run: cd frontend && pnpm install
      
      - name: Build frontend
        run: cd frontend && pnpm run build
      
      - name: Run frontend tests
        run: cd frontend && pnpm test
      
      - name: Install backend dependencies
        run: cd api && pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run backend tests
        run: cd api && pytest
      
      - name: Security scanning with Snyk
        uses: snyk/actions/python@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Deploy to Vercel (on main branch)
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
```

### 1.3. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Test individual functions and components in isolation.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage.
- Use Jest for frontend and pytest for backend.

**Integration Tests**:
- Test interactions between components and services.
- Test API endpoints with realistic data.
- Test database operations and transactions.

**End-to-End Tests**:
- Test complete user workflows.
- Use tools like Cypress or Playwright.
- Test critical paths (authentication, matching, payments).

**Performance Tests**:
- Test application performance under load.
- Use tools like Apache JMeter or k6.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimize.

## 2. Centralized Logging and Monitoring

### 2.1. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

The ELK Stack provides a comprehensive solution for centralized logging and log analysis.

**Components**:
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes logs for fast searching.
- **Logstash**: Processes and transforms log data.
- **Kibana**: Visualizes logs and provides dashboards.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Deploy Elasticsearch cluster (on GCP or self-hosted).
2. Configure Logstash to collect logs from backend and frontend.
3. Set up Kibana dashboards for visualization.
4. Configure alerts for critical errors and anomalies.

**Backend Integration**:
- Use Python logging handlers to send logs to Logstash.
- Include contextual information (user ID, request ID, timestamp).
- Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

### 2.2. Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus collects metrics from applications, while Grafana visualizes them.

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- **Application Metrics**: Request latency, error rates, throughput.
- **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O.
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection pool usage.
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, matches created, transactions processed.

**Implementation**:
1. Instrument FastAPI backend with Prometheus client.
2. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the application.
3. Set up Grafana dashboards for visualization.
4. Configure alerts for threshold breaches.

**Example Prometheus Configuration**:

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'africa-business-bridge'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```

### 2.3. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

APM tools provide detailed insights into application performance and behavior.

**Recommended Tools**:
- **New Relic**: Comprehensive APM with real-time monitoring.
- **Datadog**: Unified monitoring for infrastructure, applications, and logs.
- **Elastic APM**: Part of the Elastic Stack for application performance monitoring.

**Key Features**:
- Transaction tracing to identify slow operations.
- Error tracking and analysis.
- Real-time alerting.
- Performance baselines and anomaly detection.

## 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for GCP

### 3.1. Terraform Configuration

Terraform enables infrastructure provisioning as code, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.

**Key Resources**:
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed PostgreSQL database.
- **Cloud Run**: Serverless container deployment for backend.
- **Cloud Storage**: Object storage for uploads and backups.
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: Load balancing for traffic distribution.
- **Cloud DNS**: Managed DNS service.
- **Cloud Armor**: DDoS protection and WAF.

**Terraform Modules**:
- Create reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns.
- Organize modules by function (database, compute, networking).
- Use variables for configuration and outputs for inter-module communication.

**Example Terraform Module** (simplified):

```hcl
# modules/cloud_sql/main.tf
resource "google_sql_database_instance" "main" {
  name             = var.instance_name
  database_version = "POSTGRES_14"
  region           = var.region

  settings {
    tier = var.machine_type
    
    backup_configuration {
      enabled = true
      location = var.backup_location
    }
    
    ip_configuration {
      require_ssl = true
    }
  }
}

resource "google_sql_database" "database" {
  name     = var.database_name
  instance = google_sql_database_instance.main.name
}
```

### 3.2. Infrastructure Versioning and Documentation

- **Version Control**: Store all Terraform files in Git.
- **State Management**: Use remote state storage (GCS bucket) for team collaboration.
