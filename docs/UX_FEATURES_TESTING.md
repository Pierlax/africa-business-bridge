# UX Features Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategy and test cases for the newly implemented User Experience (UX) features in the Africa Business Bridge platform. The primary goal of this testing phase is to ensure that these features function as intended, provide a seamless user experience, and meet the specified requirements.

## 1. Overview of UX Features to be Tested

- **Guided Onboarding System**: A step-by-step wizard designed to introduce new users to the platform, focusing on helping them "Find Your Ideal Partner in Africa."
- **Progressive Disclosure System**: A mechanism to gradually reveal advanced features based on user engagement and completion of initial tasks.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: A centralized interface for administrators and potentially business users to visualize key conversion metrics and user engagement funnels.
- **Alert System**: A notification system to provide timely updates and engagement prompts to users.
- **UX Writing Guidelines**: Implementation of value-oriented labels and contextual tooltips across the platform.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Verify the correct functionality of each UX feature.
- Ensure a smooth and intuitive user flow through the onboarding process.
- Confirm that features are progressively disclosed based on predefined triggers.
- Validate the accuracy and relevance of data displayed in the analytics dashboard.
- Test the reliability and timeliness of the alert system.
- Assess the clarity, consistency, and value-orientation of UX writing elements.
- Identify and document any bugs, usability issues, or inconsistencies.

## 3. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will involve a combination of functional testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and basic performance checks.

### 3.1. Functional Testing

Functional testing will focus on verifying that each feature performs its specific function according to the design specifications.

### 3.2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

UAT will involve simulating real-world user scenarios to ensure the features meet the end-users' needs and expectations. This will include testing the overall usability and effectiveness of the UX enhancements.

### 3.3. Performance Testing (Basic)

Basic performance checks will be conducted for the analytics dashboard to ensure it loads data efficiently and remains responsive under typical usage conditions.

## 4. Test Cases

Below are detailed test cases for each UX feature.
