# Security and Compliance Guidelines for Africa Business Bridge

This document outlines the security measures, compliance requirements, and best practices for maintaining the Africa Business Bridge platform at enterprise-grade security standards.

## 1. Security Audit Framework

### 1.1. Regular Security Audits

**Objective**: Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in both frontend and backend components.

**Frequency**: Quarterly (every 3 months) for production environments, or upon significant code changes.

**Scope**:
- **Frontend**: Review for XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF protection, secure dependency management, and secure API communication.
- **Backend**: Review for SQL injection, authentication/authorization flaws, API endpoint security, and data validation.
- **Infrastructure**: Review for network security, access controls, encryption, and monitoring.

**Process**:
1. Conduct automated security scanning using tools such as OWASP ZAP, Snyk, or SonarQube.
2. Perform manual code review focusing on security-sensitive areas.
3. Test for common vulnerabilities using OWASP Top 10 checklist.
4. Document findings and create remediation plan.
5. Track remediation progress and verify fixes.

**Tools Recommended**:
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source web application security scanner.
- **Snyk**: Identifies and fixes known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis.
- **Burp Suite**: Comprehensive web application security testing.

### 1.2. Penetration Testing

**Objective**: Simulate real-world attacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Frequency**: Annually or before major releases.

**Scope**: Full application stack, including frontend, backend, APIs, and infrastructure.

**Process**:
1. Engage a reputable third-party penetration testing firm.
2. Define scope and objectives with the testing team.
3. Execute tests in a staging environment that mirrors production.
4. Document all findings with severity ratings.
5. Develop remediation plan for identified vulnerabilities.
6. Verify fixes with follow-up testing.

- Sub-processor authorization and notification.
- Data subject rights assistance.
- Audit and inspection rights.

### 2.5. Data Breach Notification

**Breach Response Plan**:
1. Detect and assess the breach.
2. Contain the breach to prevent further data loss.
3. Notify affected data subjects within 72 hours (if high risk).
4. Notify relevant data protection authorities.
5. Document the breach and response measures.
6. Implement corrective measures to prevent recurrence.

**Implementation**:
- Establish a data breach response team.
- Create incident response procedures.
- Maintain a breach register.
- Test breach response procedures regularly.

## 3. Smart Contract Security

### 3.1. Smart Contract Audits

**Objective**: Ensure smart contracts are secure, efficient, and function as intended.

**Frequency**: Before deployment to mainnet, and after significant updates.

**Process**:

1. **Internal Review**: Conduct thorough code review by experienced developers.
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow/underflow, etc.).
   - Verify logic correctness and edge cases.
   - Optimize gas usage.

2. **Automated Analysis**: Use tools to identify potential issues.
   - **Mythril**: Detects security vulnerabilities in Solidity code.
   - **Slither**: Static analysis framework for Solidity.
   - **Hardhat**: Development framework with built-in testing and debugging.

3. **External Audit**: Engage a reputable blockchain security firm.
